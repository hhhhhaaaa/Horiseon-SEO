# Horiseon-SEO
The Horiseon Update Project is a refactoring project done by Douglas Lubaway for Horiseon, the commissioners. They have asked to consolidate the code as much as possible, and include a README so that the details and changes made can be seen in a single document.

## Getting Started
The Horiseon website is very simple to set up.
Step...  
1.) Download/Clone the website to your local repo.  
2.) Open the HTML file in the web browser of your choice, preferably Chrome.  

If you'd prefer to simply view the website, it is up on this following link!

## HTML
A list of the refactors inside the HTML, in order from top to bottom...

Changed the title from website to Hoirseon, An SEO Company.  
Transformed the initial div a header.  
Transformed the div holding the list of links to a nav.  
Transformed the div for the hero class into a figure.
Transformed the hero class into meeting class.  
Inserted a hidden image for the alt text, so that Screen Reader users could listen to the image description.  
Transformed the next two major divs into sections.  
Added alt text for all images.  
Condensed the three individual content and three individual benefits classes into inner-content and inner-benefits.  
Transformed the final div into a footer.  
Updated Horiseon's Copyright.  

## CSS
A list of the refactors inside the CSS, in order from top to bottom...

Removed the seemingly unnecessary padding attribute from all.  
Added a width attribute to the body to fit the 3072w by 1920h screen I am using.  
Changed the header from a tag to an element selector.  
Changed the text and alignment of the header to better fit the final image.  
Added the SR class and attributes to better aid Screen Reader users.  
Once more, changed the hero class to meeting.  
Re-ordered and condensed the content and benefits class sets of attributes.  

## Repository
A list of the refactors inside the Repository as a whole...

Added a general use MIT license.  
Added this README.  
Changed folder assets to folder public.  

## Miscellaneous
The Screen Reader Compatibility was tested through the use of the program NVDA. Thank you!  
While the exact image does not look exactly like the final image, as requested by Horiseon, I had figured the client would prefer to have the bottom of their screen to be even with the other.  
If there are any other requests, please ask and I will fix anything right away!
